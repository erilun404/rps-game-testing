Our reflect over the game test:

Header
Its not clear what kind of heading we should use. We think it should be a h1, so the test should have information about what level of heading it contains.

RockPaperScissors
User name should be lvl 1 but we think the h1 should not be here. It should be something else.

Selection Panel
The last test is it nessecery to test, since it is not a "user" test?

This is a Rock Paper Scissor game.

First, you need to enter a player name for the game to start.

![chooseName](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d5dbc69-7e28-438b-94df-09af27470be0)

![startgame](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44b776e6-8f61-46f7-a113-d360b9f53406)

Then you will have three clickable buttons to choose between: "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" and depending on what the computer determines, you either win, lose or draw! The computer's choice is randomized between the three values.

Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock and scissors beats paper. If both the player and the computer choose the same value then it's a tie.

After each game the score is updated with +1 depending on who won, unless it's a tie, then the scores remain unchanged. You can play for as long as you like, there is no maximum score to reach.

![lose](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd83b859-d4a9-4a92-8dc7-edbc6f1a8240)

Lastly, you can start a new game with the reset button. You will have the same name as you chose from the beginning but the game will reset and the scores will go back to 0, just like after you first entered a name.

If you want to choose a new player name, you need to refresh the page instead.
